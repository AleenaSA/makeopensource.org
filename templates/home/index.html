		<h2>Your Ideas</h2>
		<p>
			If you have an idea for a project, MakeOpenSource is the 
            perfect place to share it and find like-minded people to work 
            on it with you.

		<h2>Open Source for All</h2>

			to have an interest in programming, you don't have 
			to be a computer science major to be a part of 
			MakeOpenSource. If you want to strengthen your 
			programming knowledge, MakeOpenSource's events
